# Bird-Cat-Or-Dog
This project implements a hierarchical image classification model using a two-headed ResNet-50 architecture to classify animal images into both coarse (e.g., bird, dog, reptile) and fine-grained (e.g., chihuahua, rooster) categories, while handling unseen sub-classes via threshold-based novelty detection.
